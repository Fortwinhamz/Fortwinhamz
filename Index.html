        <blockquote>
            <ul>
            <li><cite>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone
            else's life"</cite></li>
            <li><cite>"Stay hungry, Stay Foolish"</cite></li>
            <li><cite>"Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to 
            an environment where excellence is expected"</cite></li>
            <li><cite>"You can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect
            them looking backward"</cite></li>
            <li><cite>"Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. 
            It is best to you to admit them quickly and get on with 
            improving your innovations"</cite></li>
            <li><cite>"Don't let the opinion of others drown out your
            inner voice"</cite></li>
            <li><cite>Being the richest man in the cemetary doesn't matter
            to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something 
            wonderful....That's what matters to me.</cite></li>
            <li><cite>"Creativity is just connecting things</cite></li>
            <li><cite>Have the card to follow your heart and intuition.
            They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
